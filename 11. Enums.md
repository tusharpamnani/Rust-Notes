# Enums
An enum defines a user-defined type that can be one of several possible variants. Each variant can have its own associated data or be unit-like (containing no data). Enums provide a clear way to express different states or possibilities within your data.
```rust
enum Direction {
    North,
    East,
    South,
    West,
}

fn main() {
    let my_direction = Direction::North;
    let new_direction = my_direction; // No error, because Direction is Copy
    move_around(new_direction);
}

fn move_around(direction: Direction) {
    // implements logic to move a character around
}
```
