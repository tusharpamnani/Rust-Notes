# Enums
An enum defines a user-defined type that can be one of several possible variants. Each variant can have its own associated data or be unit-like (containing no data). Enums provide a clear way to express different states or possibilities within your data.
```rust
enum Direction {
    North,
    East,
    South,
    West,
}

fn main() {
    let my_direction = Direction::North;
    let new_direction = my_direction; // No error, because Direction is Copy
    move_around(new_direction);
}

fn move_around(direction: Direction) {
    // implements logic to move a character around
}
```
## **Benefits of Enums:**

- **Type Safety**: Enums enforce data integrity by restricting values to the defined variants, preventing unexpected types.
- **Readability**: Enums make code more readable by clearly expressing different states or possibilities within your data.
- **Pattern Matching**: The match expression provides a powerful way to handle different enum variants concisely.
- **Flexibility**: Enums can accommodate various data types within variants, offering versatility in data representation.


## **When to Use Enums**:

Consider using enums when you have a set of finite, related possibilities for your data. They are ideal for representing:

- States in a program 
- Choices or options
- Error types
