# Getting Started with Rust

**What is Rust?**

Rust is a compiled, statically typed language designed for building reliable and performant systems software. It offers several key advantages:

- **Memory Safety:** Rust enforces memory safety through its ownership and borrowing system, preventing memory leaks and dangling pointers. This leads to stable and predictable applications.
- **Speed and Performance:** Rust compiles to highly optimized machine code, making it suitable for situations demanding high performance.
- **Concurrency:** Rust provides built-in mechanisms for writing safe and efficient concurrent programs, leveraging ownership and borrowing to avoid data races.
- **Modern Features:** Rust offers various features like generics, closures, and pattern matching, enabling concise and expressive code.

**Who should use Rust?**

- Developers working on systems programming tasks, embedded systems, or performance-critical applications.
- Programmers seeking a language that prioritizes safety and reliability while delivering excellent performance.
- Those interested in building web services, APIs, or other software requiring concurrency and efficiency.

**Getting Started with Rust**

1. **Install Rust:** Follow the official installation guide for your operating system: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. **Write your first Rust program:** Create a file named `main.rs` and add the following code:
   
   ```rust
    fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
    }
    ```

3. **Compile and run the program:**

   ```bash
   rustc main.rs
   ./main
   ```

This will print "Hello, world!" to the console.
